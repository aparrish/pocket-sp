These are the source files for the [Pocket
SP](https://posts.decontextualize.com/pocket-sp/), a Game Boy Pocket mod I made
in the summer of 2022. Here's a description of the directories in this
repository and what they contain:

* `boards`: KiCad source files for the flex PCB connector boards
* `model`: FreeCAD source files for the shell
* `stl`: Exported STL files for the various parts of the shell

You can get the flex PCB boards directly from [OSH
Park](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/3J882cTI). (Make sure to order them
as flex PCBs, not regular PCBs!) For the shell, you'll need to download the STL
files from this repository (or export them from the FreeCAD file) and then
print them on your own 3D printer, or send them to the fabricator of your
choice. I recommend ordering an SLA resin print from
[PCBWay](https://pcbway.com/) or [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/).

Note that there is a lot more to this build than just the shell and the PCBs!
